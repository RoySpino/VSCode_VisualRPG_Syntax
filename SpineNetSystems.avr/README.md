# RPG for Visual Studio Code

## What is this?
Syntax highlighting for IBM RPG, RPGLE and ASNA Visual RPG. 
Based on the extension made by Niels Liisberg, R-RPG is made to
provide support for both structured and free form RPG. 
I also wanted add support for ASNA Visual RPG mostly because no 
one has bothered to add that extension yet.

Extension is on  [GitHub](https://github.com/RoySpino/VSCode_VisualRPG_Syntax), contributors are welcome.

As for the meaning of the first R in R-RPG. it could mean Revised,
Revision, Reimagined or Roy's RPG take your pick.


some of the featues include:
1. code refrences for fixed format coding
2. insert logic blocks such as If's, Select's and Dow
3. control specification higlighting in both seventh or first 
   columns (for those who are copying and pasteing from a 5250 editer)
